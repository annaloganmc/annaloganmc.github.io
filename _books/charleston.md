Crawford does a great job recounting the history of Charleston as it relates to the current persistence of racial and environmental justice issues. I enjoyed the approach of using stories from important individuals who embody the themes of these issues; it added a personal touch beyond the history lesson that demonstrates how Charleston's horrific history continues to manifest into negative impacts for community members today.

At times I think she went a little too far into depicting Charleston as this hellscape of a city and it became apparent she never lived here. Although given the myriad of issus Charleston is set to face in the next century, I can certainly see it beginning to transition that way.

Also, it had a quote from my boss Joshua Robinson featured in it which was cool to read! It made me feel really connected to the narrative and see how my specific work as an engineer can fit into the puzzle. Great read for anyone interested in the past, present, or future of Charleston.
