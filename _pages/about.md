Anna Logan is a second-year Master's student in the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability studying Geospatial Data Science. Her research interests lie in the application of nature-based solutions for flood mitigation in the coastal southeast.

Supplemented by her background in Biosystems Engineering, Anna Logan has experience in hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, geospatial analysis and remote sensing, and modeling of environmental data. She has worked on a variety of projects and landscapes across the Southeast such as the salt marshes and tidal creek systems of Charleston, SC, the coastal watershed of Edisto Island, SC, and the frequently inundated town of Mexico Beach, FL.

After completion of her Master's degree, Anna Logan aims to continue working in the field of coastal ecological restoration and nature-based design as an engineer or geospatial analyst.
